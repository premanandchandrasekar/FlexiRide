# FlexiRide

Problem statement:

Application supercharge with Ola API's.

Our solution

Our solution was to provide Ola truely to all. No matter how far the technology(connectivity,basic/smart phone) has advanced it surely didn't reach everyone in India. Ola provides an awesome service to public, but limited to people with smartphones and who has access to the internet. This is were our solution accomplishes filling the gap by providing means of access to everyone needless of one has connectivity, basic/smart phone.

We provide an interface that can be integreted in public places, which we shortly called "FlexiRide" station. Using our FlexiRide anyone can enjoy a ride with Ola by eliminating the above constraints.This make more people connect with Ola. And also we are providing sharing option to cut the price for the users.
